## Exp6 - Two agents chatting in a panel discussion with the user as moderator

### Objective
- Use Qwen3 as part of a three person group chat.
- In the chat panel discussion there are two models.
- The user is the discussion moderator.


### Notes
- The Qwen3 models worked fine in this setup.
- The speed is slow due to the fact that the model is thinking.
