We understand it can be disappointing when the weather doesnâ€™t cooperate with your plans, especially when you were inspired to write a song about it!\\n\\nApril in Arizona typically sees average daytime highs around 29Â°C (84Â°F) with about 12 hours of sunshine per day. You can expect a mix of sunny days, and sometimes there are days with cloud cover or even a little rain. While we can't directly control the weather, we certainly appreciate your feedback and will share it with our team as we review our communications about Arizona's climate. \\n\\nWe hope you've been able to continue enjoying your creative endeavors, and we hope to welcome you back to Arizona again soon for a sunnier experience.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nSarah, Resident Manager\n"
